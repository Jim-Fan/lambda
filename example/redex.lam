# In lambda calculus, below expression is expected to yield 10 as
# result. In current implementation, the whole input expression is 
# returned instead, which is quite odd. This is because, in lambda.c::_eval(),
# when top level expression is a lambda, further evaluation to its 
# body is not carried out
